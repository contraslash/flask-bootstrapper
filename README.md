# Flask Bootstrapper

## UNMANTAINED

The idea of have a django like application writted in Flask is against the principles of the microframework

This is a simple flask project generator, also creates an blueprint schema based on
a scalable file architecture used at [contraslash](https://contraslash.com/)

To use this generator

```bash
# Create a new virtualenv with name auto_generated_flask
python -m venv auto_generated_flask
# install flask bootstrapper
pip install flask_bootstrapper
# Then just execute
flask-bootstrapper.py
```
